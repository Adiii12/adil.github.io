            Welcome to my world! My name is Masha, and I specialize in writing
            top-notch copy that is all about elevating consciousness and
            transforming your life from the inside-out. I create content in the
            field of alternative wellness, and make the complexities of the
            energetic and spiritual worlds accessible to all while providing the
            depth that such topics need - whether your audience is freshly
            embarking on their inner journey or is at an adept level.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Fascinated since a young age by all things metaphysical, my life turned upside down in 2015 when I found myself on the path of Shamanism, and which revealed to me all that I had been seeking. Continuously deepening my journey and studies, I have since then opened my own healing practice, and have become a Tuina therapist - the hands-on branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine. I am also a Kambo practitioner, Kambo being a poisonous frog - yes you read that right - that has its roots in the ancient world of Amazonian Shamanism, and which has incredible health benefits that continue to be studied by Western science. </p>
